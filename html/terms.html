<p><strong>4. Subscription, Billing and Cancellation Policies</strong></p>

<p><strong>4.1  Subscription</strong></p>

<p>In order to start your ongoing Company monthly Subscription, you must simply go to our subscription page and complete the form at lovelyposy.co/subscribe/.  You will be required to provide your full name, your complete address, your phone number, your valid email address, your valid credit card and billing information.  This will sign you up for a Subscription with Company.  For your convenience as a Company user, all information that you provide to Company is subject to Company&apos;s Privacy Policy, which can be found here and is incorporated by reference.</p>

<p>A Subscription consists of the Product delivered bi-monthly, i.e., twice a month. Flowers will be delivered the first and third Tuesday of every month (&quot;Delivery Date&quot;). Delivery dates are subject to change at Company&apos;s sole discretion. Each month of your Subscription, the selection of Products may change. Company cannot guarantee that a selection available in a particular timeframe will be available in any subsequent timeframe. BY SUBSCRIBING YOU AGREE TO PAY THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUPPLIED EACH MONTH.</p>

<p>If you purchase your subscription by the 28th of any given month, you will be eligible to begin receiving your Products by the first delivery date of the following month.</p>

<p>When you purchase a Subscription, you agree to receive transactional emails regarding your flower deliveries. In addition, you agree to receive emails promoting any special offer(s), including third party offers. You may opt-out from receiving special promotions by emailing <a href="mailto:support@lovelyposy.co">support@lovelyposy.co</a> or selecting the Unsubscribe link as may be provided in the applicable e-mail correspondence.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 Payment Methods; Billing; Automatic Monthly Membership Renewals</strong></p>

<p>All information that you provide to Company when you purchase a Subscription, including your credit card information, is subject to Company&apos;s Privacy Policy, which can be found here, and is incorporated by reference. The price of the Products and Services is payable in full before delivery. We accept the following credit cards at this time: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover.</p>

<p>You will automatically be billed on the 19th of each month for your ongoing Subscription. For your convenience and continuous Subscription benefits as a user, if your payment method reaches its expiration date and you do not update your credit card information on file with us or cancel your Subscription, you authorize us to continue billing that credit card on file, including extending the expiration date until we are notified by you or the credit card company that the account is no longer valid. We encourage you to constantly update your payment method information by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@lovelyposy.co">support@lovelyposy.co</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of your Subscription term (whether one, three or six months), it will be renewed automatically for another term of the same length. </p>

<p>We use a third party payment service in lieu of directly processing your credit card information. By submitting your credit card information, you grant Company the right to store and process your information with the third party payment service, which it may change from time to time; you agree that Company will not be responsible for any failures of the third party to adequately protect such information. All financial matters regarding your information are subject to the conditions of the third party payment service provider&apos;s terms of service; the current versionscan be found at http://www.moonclerk.com/terms-of-service/ and https://stripe.com/us/terms. You acknowledge that we may change the third party payment service and move your information to other service providers that encrypt your information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or other comparable security technology.</p>

<p><strong>4.3 Cancellation</strong></p>

<p>You may cancel your Subscription at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@lovelyposy.co">support@lovelyposy.co</a> and putting &quot;CANCEL&quot; in the subject line.  Subscriptions can be canceled for a full refund (if already billed), up until five (5) days prior to the delivery date OF THE MONTH&apos;S FIRST DELIVERY. There will be no refunds after there has been a delivery for that month.</p>

<p>Cancellation requests received after the first delivery of the month shall take effect the following month. If you have any problems, please email <a href="mailto:support@lovelyposy.co">support@lovelyposy.co</a>.  Company requires a reasonable amount of time to process your Subscription cancellation request. If you cancel your Subscription, you will enjoy your Subscription benefits until the end of the then-current Subscription term, and your Subscription benefits will expire at the end of the then-current Subscription term for which you have paid. You will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Subscription fees paid for any unused months of the then-current Subscription term.</p>

<p><strong>5. Privacy</strong></p>
